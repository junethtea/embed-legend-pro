about=Embed Legend is the ultimate productivity booster for QGIS users, particularly in the Telecommunications and GIS sectors. It creates a live, draggable floating legend panel that stays on your map canvas. Key features include:
    * Interactive visibility toggle (click to hide/show layers with a strikethrough effect).
    * Multi-layer stacking with clear separators.
    * Real-time feature counts and percentage (%) statistics.
    * Professional KMZ (Google Earth) export with auto-embedded legend images on the screen.
    * Smart Labeling: Automatically detects SiteID columns for Sectoral/Polygon layers, keeping Drive Test (Points) and Grid geometries clean without text clutter.
    * Direct MapInfo MIF export with hardcoded thematics.
    Export thousands of complex RF data points (Drive Test, Covmo/MR/MDT, Gcell) cleanly and efficiently in less than a minute.
